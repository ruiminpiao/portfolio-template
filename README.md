## Concept

- **Theme:** Creative Portfolio Template
- **Narrative:** This is a website template so that anyone is able to build their website portfolio, without having to do it from scartch. They should substitute the texts with the information that they see more fitting, and the images should also be switched to showcase their works.
- **Goal:** To help other people to build their portfolio on an online site, and allowing them to have a version of their portfolio that is different from a PDF format.
