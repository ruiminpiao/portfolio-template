## Project Concept

### What are you building?

<!-- Describe your project in 2-3 sentences -->
This is a template designed mainly for other designers in search of a base from which they can build their web portfolio.

### Who is it for?

Mainly for designers, but it could be use by anyone who needs to showcase their work, both visually and through text.

### Why does it matter?

Many people are slightly taken aback when it comes to creating a website for their portfolio, so the main goal of this site is to help those people to get started with that without having to worry much on whether the website will work or not.
